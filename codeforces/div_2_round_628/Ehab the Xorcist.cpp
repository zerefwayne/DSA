/*
    Given 2 integers u and v, find the shortest array such that bitwise-xor of its elements is u, and the sum of its elements is v.

    Input
    The only line contains 2 integers u and v (0≤u,v≤1018).

    Output
    If there's no array that satisfies the condition, print "-1". Otherwise:

    The first line should contain one integer, n, representing the length of the desired array. The next line should contain n positive integers, the array itself. If there are multiple possible answers, print any.
