/*
    You are given an array a of length n that has a special condition: every element in this array has at most 7 divisors. Find the length of the shortest non-empty subsequence of this array product of whose elements is a perfect square.

    A sequence a is a subsequence of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

    Input
    The first line contains an integer n (1≤n≤105) — the length of a.

    The second line contains n integers a1, a2, …, an (1≤ai≤106) — the elements of the array a.

    Output
    Output the length of the shortest non-empty subsequence of a product of whose elements is a perfect square. If there are several shortest subsequences, you can find any of them. If there's no such subsequence, print "-1".
